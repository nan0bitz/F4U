I checked the local library // Toronto Public Library 416-395-5424 (Termeh Norouzi - Adult Literacy Coodinator) // closest to Dufferin and Eglinton asking about what the 'adult literacy program' was about or consists of.
The contact who spoke with me was a staff member however, he had no details on what the actual programs consisted. Though, he did tell me one of the libraries
objectives is focused around getting individuals who spent time in prison and provides them with a program so they can get engaged again with
society. The comment makes me think about what Andrew, Israel and I spoke about where my analytical program could benefit these people.
  Discuss your concept with 'Termeh' and see what other areas the library focuses on; try capturing all relevant details.
