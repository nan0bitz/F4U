Last week I met a few people who do volunteer work in the community of Dufferin. While I'm not sure of the ward district its basically closest
to Dufferin and Eglinton. Enzo, who has spent the last 10 years running events such as Movie Nights; Isabel who handles the graphics and arts 
during some of the events; she puts effort into getting children in the community to participate in various arts; painting, drawing, etc.
Enzo has an assistant who coordinates all processes such as events; time frames; advertising and getting volunteers to assist.
 Since I now reside in the community and notice that it is not as bad as I really thought it was, after speaking with Enzo for about 3 hours
 there are definately somethings that I can do to volunteer and assist.
