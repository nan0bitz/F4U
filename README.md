# F4U
Project F4U (HyperVector)

Research data and associated details are for primary development of the F4U project; aka 'HyperVector'. My deep interest in this concept has driven me to research, analyze, drill down and assess things which impact directly or indirectly the functionality of this system to aid people with the awareness that a unique group of skill sets exist in all of us.

Reason: After observing shared experiences from a number of individuals who attended University/College; I thought about the trend that has been consistent over years even before I started working in the corporate field. The trend which may not be a trend per se, is that most people who begin their profession once aquiring all academics required do not work in the field they desire. Why? The reasons are many .. such as the course they took was not what they thought it would be,..etc. I pondered and thought, instead of identifying the many known reasons, why not look at this process and observe the unused space of opportunity?
Using business analytics, we could build an algorithm that would sift templates of data (based on the core engine to surface unique and resourceful information) relative to 30min assessment where the individual provided indepth information about themselves.
